<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a forth-year PhD student at the University of Florida, advised by Prof. [Jie Xu](https://jiexu.ece.ufl.edu/).  Prior to that, I was a master student at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research interests focus on Edge Computing, Federated Learning and Large Langeuage Model Fine-tuning.
